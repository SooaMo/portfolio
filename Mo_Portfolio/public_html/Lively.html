                        <h2>Objective</h2>
                        <p>Our team was tasked with designing a web camera for a persona related to SIAT (SFU Interactive and Technology), using plastic and paper as the primary materials. The goal was to create a unique webcam that would be tailored to the needs of SIAT students.</p>

                        <h2>Approach</h2>
                        <p>During the Covid period, we had to take a video conference at home, not at school, and manage a team project. In other words, cameras have become a necessity for everyone. Like various electronic devices, such as speakers on a desk, rather than being attached to a monitor or laptop, cameras can also exist in various shapes. We've decided to design a webcam that can be customized uniquely with a SIAT student like us as a persona.

                        <p>Each of the team members sketched three initial designs, and among them, my sketch of the tree-shaped design received the best feedback, so I led the design of our team project.
                            <b>My main role:</b> By doing various sketches, I thought a lot about allowing my team members to choose from multiple options. Also, it was my role to design the two main materials, plastic and paper, in a balanced way.
                            <b>Difficulty:</b> Using paper was difficult. I thought a lot about how to use it, and I thought it would be good to use paper for customization by researching it. Therefore, our product can be change the open parts of plastic to customized paper, and I was able to balance the two materials by using paper in various parts.

                            We designed the product using the main materials in a balanced. Although there were many mistakes in the production process, I could produce and present the finished product in time by collaborating with my team members.

                            <h3>Takeaway:</h3> 
                            During the Lively project, I learned that time management is crucial when designing products. I discovered that mistakes during the assembly process can occur due to incorrect measurements, which can lead to a delay in the production process. Furthermore, I learned that 3D printing can also result in failures, which may require re-production.

Despite the challenges, I was able to successfully collaborate with my team members to create a unique webcam design that balances plastic and paper materials. Through sketching and 3D modelling, I played a significant role in designing the tree-shaped webcam, which received positive feedback from our team. Overall, the project taught me the importance of careful planning and time management in product design, as well as the value of teamwork in overcoming challenges.
