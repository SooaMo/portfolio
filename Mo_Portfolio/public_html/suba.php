                        <h2>Approach</h2>
                        <p>We initially had to think about what type of users we wanted to focus on, eg construction workers, elderly adults, especially those with arthritis, or 6-year-old children.
                        
                        Our initial design was very simple.  We decided to get feedback from our professor and classmates to enhance our design.

                            <b>Difficulty:</b> Sketches were made in consideration of the dimensions for children, but there were various structural problems that we came across when we actually created the model.  When modelling, we tried to keep the structure as simple as possible in order to create a stable 3D model.

                            We designed the flashlight to fit the size of a child's hand. The on/off buttons make it easy for the child to use the flashlight and control the propellerâ€™s brightness.  We wanted to ensure that children have the alot of fun using the flashlight.
                            
                            <h3>Takeaway:</h3> 
                            1)I think we used too many colours on the product. I felt that it would have been a better product design if we reduced the type of colour based on children's preferred colour.
                            2)During the project, there was not enough time to do research, but I did do some brief interviews with parents who had children.

                            However, I still felt this was a fun collaborative project where I was able to implement models and present designs and look forward to working on more projects like this in the future.
